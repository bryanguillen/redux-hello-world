# Redux - TODO List (Hello World)

## Description

### General

Repository contains "hello world" code for `redux` in the form of a todo list.

### Purpose

The purpose of this is to better learn `Redux`, since I am super **curious** about it,
but more specifically, a flux-like architecture, which will help me better think about
application state for large scale apps.
